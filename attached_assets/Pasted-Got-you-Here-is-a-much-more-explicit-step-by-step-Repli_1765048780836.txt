Got you. Here is a **much more explicit, step by step Replit prompt** that tells the agent *exactly* what to build and how every part should behave. You can copy and paste this directly into Replit.

This version removes ambiguity and gives clear instructions for UI, features, interactions, and code structure.

---

# ✅ **REPLIT PROMPT, FULLY SPECIFIED**

**Build an app called FitMuse. Make a complete working front-end prototype using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app should run entirely in the browser with no backend. The UI must be simple, clean, and easy to follow.**

### **CORE REQUIREMENTS**

#### **1. Create a landing screen with:**

* A title that says “FitMuse”.
* A short subtitle that says “Your creative outfit co-designer”.
* A button that says “Start”.

When the user presses “Start”, load the main interface.

---

### **2. Main Interface Sections**

Divide the layout into three panels:

#### **A. Mood Selector Panel (left side)**

Include:

* A dropdown menu with moods: Calm, Energetic, Dark, Bright, Soft, Bold.
* A button that says “Set Mood”.

When the user selects a mood and clicks “Set Mood”, store that mood in a variable called `currentMood`.

#### **Mood Behavior:**

Each mood should map to a color palette:

* Calm: pastel blues and soft neutrals
* Energetic: bright reds, yellows, and color blocking
* Dark: black, charcoal, deep greens
* Bright: vibrant multicolors
* Soft: creams, beiges, pinks
* Bold: high contrast, sharp silhouettes

You do not need a full ML model. Use simple rules:
Store palettes in arrays and reference them when generating outfits.

---

#### **B. Closet Upload Panel (middle)**

This panel must allow the user to upload photos of their clothing items.

Include:

* An image upload input (`<input type="file" multiple>`)
* A “Add to Closet” button
* A scrollable area that displays thumbnails of the uploaded clothes

Store each uploaded clothing image in an array called `closetItems`.

**Rules:**

* Accept .jpg, .jpeg, .png
* Display thumbnails immediately
* Do not use a backend, store everything in memory during the session

---

#### **C. Creative Tools Panel (right side)**

Include two creative tools:

**Tool 1: Style Adjustments**

* A dropdown for “Change vibe”: options like Streetwear, Minimalist, Vintage, Sporty, Romantic
* A dropdown for “Color Direction”: More neutral, More contrast, Monochrome, Match the mood palette
* A button that says “Apply Adjustments”

**Tool 2: Sketch Prompt**

* A small drawing canvas (250x250) where the user can draw a rough silhouette
* Use simple pen drawing
* A button that says “Use Sketch as Inspiration”

Store results of these adjustments in variables:

* `styleVibe`
* `colorDirection`
* `sketchData` (base64 string of the sketch image)

---

### **3. Outfit Generator**

At the bottom of the screen, add a large button:

### **“Generate Outfit”**

When the user clicks it:

1. Check that:

   * `currentMood` is set
   * At least 2 items in `closetItems` exist

2. Run simple rule-based generation:

   * Pick 2 to 4 clothing items from the closet
   * Match the colors of the selected items to the palette of `currentMood`
   * Modify the selection based on `styleVibe`
     Example: if “Streetwear”, prefer hoodies, baggy pants, sneakers (use filename keywords)
   * Apply `colorDirection` rules
     Example: if “Monochrome”, filter items by closest color value
   * Save the combined result as `generatedOutfit`

3. Display the final outfit in an output panel:

   * Show the selected clothing images
   * Add a text description explaining why the outfit matches the mood and the creative edits

---

### **4. Output Panel**

Create a large area at the bottom or in a modal that shows:

* A row of the final chosen clothing items

* A short explanation generated by simple logic, for example:
  “This outfit matches your Energetic mood with strong contrast and a sporty vibe. Your sketch suggested a loose silhouette so the app prioritized oversized pieces.”

* A “Regenerate” button

* A “Start Over” button

---

### **5. Code Requirements**

* Use clean modular JavaScript

* Add comments explaining key functions

* Put all logic in separate functions, for example:

  * `generateOutfit()`
  * `applyMood()`
  * `applyStyleAdjustments()`
  * `useSketchData()`
  * `renderClosetItems()`

* No backend, no frameworks required, but vanilla JS must be organized

* CSS should be responsive and simple

---

### **6. Deliverables**

The final prototype must include:

* index.html
* styles.css
* script.js
* A working interface
* Functional mood selector
* Working closet upload
* Functional creative tools
* A rule-based outfit generator

This does not need perfect ML accuracy. It only needs to behave consistently and demonstrate the idea.

---

If you want, I can also write:

* a **technical architecture diagram**,
* a **pitch script**,
* or a **detailed folder structure for the repo**.

Just tell me.
