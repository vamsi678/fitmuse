Replit prompt

Build the next version of FitMuse, a browser based outfit app. The main goal for this version is:

Parse the clothing images the user uploads and only generate outfits using those exact items, never imaginary clothes.

Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, no backend.

1. Closet image parsing

Add an image upload area where the user selects multiple files.

For each uploaded image, do the following in JavaScript:

Load the image into a hidden <canvas> element.

Extract basic metadata:

an id

the original file name

a guessed clothing type (top, bottom, outerwear, shoes, accessory). You can guess using simple keyword matching in the file name, for example, “jeans”, “pants”, “skirt”, “hoodie”, “jacket”, “shoes”, “boots”.

a rough dominant color category by averaging pixels on the canvas and mapping to labels like “light”, “dark”, “blue”, “red”, “neutral”.

Store each item in a closet array as an object:

{
  id: string,
  src: string,          // image URL for display
  type: "top" | "bottom" | "outerwear" | "shoes" | "accessory",
  dominantColor: "light" | "dark" | "blue" | "red" | "neutral" | "other",
  filename: string
}


Show every uploaded item in a “My Closet” grid so the user can see exactly what is available.

Important rule:
If an image is not in the closet array, it must never appear in a generated outfit.

2. Connect to mood and vibe data

Create two JavaScript objects, moodConfig and vibeConfig, from the JSON I will provide (moodboards and vibe boards). Each mood and vibe includes:

preferred color ranges

preferred item types

preferred silhouettes or fit (you can model this as tags)

You do not need to implement real silhouettes, just respect color and item type preferences in your selection logic.

3. Outfit generation rules

Create a generateOutfit() function that does all of this:

Read the user’s selected currentMood and currentVibe.

Filter closet items to only those that match the mood and vibe preferences:

color compatibility, for example Calm selects light and neutral colors, Energetic selects bright or high contrast colors

type balance, for example at least one top and one bottom, optionally outerwear and shoes

Randomly pick 2 to 4 items from the filtered list, but always:

include one top and one bottom if available

try to add shoes if any are uploaded

If there are not enough matching items:

fall back to the closest items by color or type, still coming only from the closet array

never create or display an item that does not exist in closet

Return a generatedOutfit object:

{
  items: ClosetItem[],
  explanation: string
}


The explanation should be a short sentence built in JavaScript, for example:

“This outfit uses soft neutrals from your closet to match your Calm mood with a Minimalist vibe.”

4. Displaying the outfit

Create an “Outfit Result” panel that reads generatedOutfit.items and shows each clothing image from src in a row or grid.

Under the images, show the explanation text.

Add buttons:

“Regenerate” calls generateOutfit() again using the same mood and vibe but possibly different items from the closet.

“Start Over” clears the generated outfit.

5. Hard rule for the hackathon demo

The app must never show clothing that is not part of the uploaded closet images.

Do not use stock images for generated outfits.

All outfits in the demo must be built purely from the images the user added during that session.

Focus on making this logic reliable and easy to demo, with clear comments explaining each step in script.js.

You can paste this whole block into Replit as your main prompt. If you want, I can also write the actual moodConfig and vibeConfig variables in JavaScript so you can drop them straight into your code.

no I already have a working website I want it to be so that it uses the ai to only choose clothing from the closet I dont want a seperate version

Thought for 20s

Got it. You already have the site working, you just want the AI part to only pick from the user’s closet, not invent new clothes.

Here is a prompt you can paste into Replit for your existing project. It tells the agent to keep your current UI, and only change the outfit generation logic so the AI selects from the closet items you already store.

You can adjust variable names if yours are different.

✅ Replit prompt to lock AI to the closet only

Use the current codebase as is. Do not rebuild the UI or create a separate version of the app.

Right now the app already:

lets the user upload clothing images into a “closet”

shows those items on the page

has a mood and vibe selector

has a button that generates an outfit

I want you to modify the existing outfit generation logic so that:

Any outfit that is generated by AI can only use items that are already in the user’s closet data, never imaginary items.

1. Treat the closet as the single source of truth

In the code, find where the closet items are stored. If there is not a single array yet, create one and normalize around it, for example:

// Example shape, adapt to what exists
const closetItems = [
  {
    id: "item-1",
    src: "blob-or-url",
    type: "top",         // "bottom" | "outerwear" | "shoes" | "accessory"
    color: "light blue", // or your own color tags
    tags: ["denim", "casual"]
  }
];


Make sure every uploaded clothing image is stored in this array, and this array is what the UI uses when it renders the closet grid.

2. AI should only select from closetItems, not invent new ones

Create or update a function something like:

async function generateOutfitFromCloset({ mood, vibe }) { ... }


Inside this function:

Gather the current closetItems array.

Create a compact JSON representation of the closet to send to the AI, for example:

const closetSummary = closetItems.map(item => ({
  id: item.id,
  type: item.type,
  color: item.color,
  tags: item.tags || []
}));


Call the AI API (or the existing AI helper in this project) with a clear system or user prompt like:

“You are a stylist. Here is the user’s closet as JSON. Only choose items by their id from this list. Do not invent any new clothing. The mood is X and the vibe is Y. Return a JSON object with an array called selectedIds containing 2 to 4 item ids that form a good outfit.”

Pass closetSummary, mood, and vibe into that prompt.

Parse the AI response in JavaScript. Expect JSON like:

{
  "selectedIds": ["item-3", "item-7", "item-10"]
}

3. Enforce the rule in code

After you get the AI’s response, enforce the constraint in JavaScript so the UI can never show a non closet item:

const selected = response.selectedIds || [];

const outfitItems = selected
  .map(id => closetItems.find(item => item.id === id))
  .filter(Boolean); // drops any id that was not found


If outfitItems is empty or missing a top/bottom, fall back to a simple rule based selection from closetItems, but still only use items from closetItems.

Never create new items for the outfit that are not already in closetItems.

4. Connect to the existing UI

Wherever the “Generate Outfit” button is wired, replace the old logic with a call to generateOutfitFromCloset({ mood, vibe }), then:

render outfitItems using their existing src images

show any explanation text that the AI returned, or build one from mood, vibe, and the chosen items

Do not change the visual design of the page. Only update the data flow so that:

AI chooses by id

UI renders only items that come from closetItems

5. Summary of requirements

Keep my current website structure, components, and styling.

Use AI only to select from the existing closet items, never to invent new clothing names or images.

Enforce the rule in code by filtering AI output through the closetItems array before rendering.
