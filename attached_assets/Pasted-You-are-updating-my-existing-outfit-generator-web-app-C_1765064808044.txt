You are updating my existing outfit generator web app.

Current app behavior:
- The user uploads photos of clothes that are actually in their closet.
- You remove the background from each clothing image using a free background removal API key.
- The app tags each item by type, like top, bottoms, shoes, outerwear, accessories.
- The AI then builds outfits only from this closet, no random internet clothes, and shows the final outfit as a composite image made from those uploaded items.

New feature I want:
Add an optional "Style from a celebrity or character" feature.

Detailed requirements:

1. UI changes
- On the main outfit creation screen, add an optional file upload input labeled something like "Upload a celebrity or character outfit for inspiration (optional)".
- The user should still be able to generate outfits without using this feature, so make sure the flow still works if no image is uploaded.
- If a style image is uploaded, show a small preview and a short message like "We will match this style using your closet only".

2. Handling the inspiration image
- When the user uploads a celebrity or character image, send it to the backend along with the normal outfit request.
- On the backend, treat this as a “reference outfit”.
- Extract basic style info from the image, for example:
  - Main colors
  - Type of top, bottoms, shoes, outerwear, accessories
  - Overall vibe like casual, formal, streetwear, cozy, etc.
- You do not need to build a perfect ML model from scratch, but design the code so it is clear where we would plug in a model or API that detects clothing and colors from the reference image.

3. Matching the reference outfit to the user’s closet
- Based on the detected items in the reference image, choose the closest possible match from the user’s existing closet items.
- For example, if the celebrity wears blue wide leg jeans, a white cropped top, and black boots:
  - Find pants in the closet that are most similar in category and color to the jeans.
  - Find a top that matches the type and color of the reference top as closely as possible.
  - Find shoes that are closest in style and color to the boots.
- If there is no good match for a specific piece, gracefully skip that type or show a simple message like "No similar shoes found in your closet, showing the rest of the outfit".

4. Generating the final outfit result
- The final generated outfit must still use only the user’s closet items, never import new clothing from the internet.
- Use the same background removal and compositing approach we already use for normal outfits.
- Combine the chosen items (top, bottoms, shoes, etc.) into one outfit image, just like before.
- Also show a simple text breakdown like:
  - "Inspired by your uploaded image:
     - Top: [closet item name or simple description]
     - Bottoms: [...]
     - Shoes: [...]"

5. Code structure and integration
- Work in the same language and framework as the existing app. If there is no code yet, create a simple web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or a basic React setup, and show how this feature would fit in.
- Clearly separate:
  - Frontend components for the file input and preview
  - API routes or backend functions that handle the reference image and outfit matching
  - Utility functions that compare closet items to the detected style features from the celebrity image
- Include comments in the code explaining each main step so it is easy for me to tweak later.

6. Deliverables
- Update or create all necessary frontend files.
- Update or create backend endpoints for:
  - Receiving the closet items and the optional celebrity image
  - Matching the celebrity outfit to closet items
  - Returning the chosen outfit pieces and any messages
- Show me how to run the project and which parts I could later connect to a real clothing detection API.

Implement this feature end to end so I can upload a celebrity or character image and get a similar outfit generated only from my closet.
